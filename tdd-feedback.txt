 + consider moving the filename accompanying each script box to the top left corner.  i was in Part 3 before i even noticed it, and had been guessing which of the `tests.py` to use.  In the case of smaller resolutions, it might not be visible until until all the code has been read.
 - especially since there is refactoring involved, it might be helpful to have a version of the code that corresponds to the expected results after each lesson (perhaps as a tag, or branch).  This could also help a user jump in at any lesson.
 - i found the fts to be spotty (i suspect a selenium issue); they would often fail early in an unreproducable manner.  After repeatedly hitting the fts, i would be able to power through.  Any word on that? Examples:

Part 1
 - don't like the "yes, we really meant it" explanation of INSTALLED_APPS.  Prefer something like the "enabled" language in https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#installed-apps
 - "It's OK to ignore these for now - we'll deal with templates for 500 errors in a later tutorial." ... i didn't find that later tutorial, but nominate Part 3


Part 2
 - i don't think the user was instructed to run syncdb for the new Poll model, at 'Now, when you click the link you should see a menu a bit like this.'  The message, "Remember, you may need to syncdb..." comes late
 - you might want to explain why 'body' is redefined in the test after every click, for a novice user


Part 3
 - 'ViewDoesNotExist: Could not import polls.views.poll. View does not exist in module polls.views.' - i do not get this error when following the instructions, although view does indeed not exist.

Part 4
 - show import for PollVoteForm before `return render(request, 'poll.html', {'poll': poll, 'form': form})`

Part 5
 - grammar: `# results.  it still says # "100 %: very awesome".`  Capitalize "It" and "Very"
 - i propose a test-driven way of refactoring tests: have them copy the model tests to an empty `test_models.py`, fail when the imports are missing, then add the necessary imports (rather than copy the whole file and remove parts) because the tests can guide that process.  This way, you don't end up with unnecessary imports in the resulting modules (like importing a form in the model tests) although it is a bit more tedious.  You don't seem to have a beef with tedium, though...
 - Part 4 (and 5) says `test_page_shows_choices_using_form` goes in SinglePollViewTest, but it's in the forms tests, according to the repo
 - code underneath `Dealing with POST requests in a view` doesn't indicate that there is still (or could be) a `test_page_shows_poll_title_and_no_votes_message` method before `test_page_shows_choices_using_form`
 - grammar: `# check it's votes have gone up by 1` : "its"
